/**
 * Filter rules:
 *  1. Drop turns whose `head_sha_at_snap` is NULL (legacy row whose migration
 *     backfill failed — can't reason about it).
 *  2. Drop turns whose `prev_sha..snap_sha` is an empty diff (legacy / dedupe
 *     bypass / collapsed range).
 *  3. **Consumed check** (replaces the old strict `head_sha_at_snap == HEAD`
 *     equality). For every file the turn touched, compare the blob at that
 *     path in `tree(head_sha_at_snap)` vs `tree(HEAD)`. If *every* touched
 *     file's blob differs (or one side absent and the other defined), the
 *     work landed in HEAD's history → drop. If *any* file's blob is
 *     unchanged between snap-time HEAD and current HEAD, the file was never
 *     touched by intervening commits → that part of the turn's work is
 *     still pending → keep. Survives rebase / merge / squash / amend /
 *     external commits, where strict HEAD equality over-fires and orphans
 *     turns whose work is uncommitted.
 *  4. Drop turns whose changed files have zero overlap with the current
 *     working tree changes — a turn whose files are fully reverted (without
 *     a commit) no longer corresponds to anything in `git status`.
 *
 * Re-thread `prev_snapshot_sha` so dropped turns don't leave dangling SHAs:
 * each surviving row's prev points at the prior surviving row's snapshot, so
 * consecutive diffs remain meaningful.
