/**
 * v127 disk-dir migration helper.
 *
 * v127 renamed the "assets" feature to "artifacts" in the DB. The on-disk
 * directory was meant to be renamed in lockstep — but a copy-paste typo in
 * the original boot-time block left both `oldDir` and `newDir` pointing at
 * `artifacts/`, so the rename never fired and pre-v127 user content stayed
 * orphaned in `assets/` while the read path looked in `artifacts/`. Affected
 * users see "Write markdown..." placeholder for every artifact.
 *
 * This helper handles three states a user can be in by the time the fix
 * ships:
 *  - noop:   only `artifacts/` exists (clean install on v127+).
 *  - rename: only `assets/` exists (never opened buggy v127 build).
 *  - merge:  both exist (opened buggy build → a fresh empty `artifacts/`
 *            was created by `db:artifacts:create` / watcher / mkdir-on-demand
 *            while real content remained in `assets/`).
 *
 * Merge is non-destructive: a file in `assets/` is moved only when no file
 * with the same path exists in `artifacts/`. Conflicts are counted and left
 * in place so a user can recover them manually if needed.
