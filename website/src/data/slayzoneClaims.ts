    'Kanban board is primary UX — task visibility, status flow, drag-and-drop, subtasks, dependencies.',
    'Fully local-first: no login, no cloud sync, no mandatory account. SQLite on your machine.',
    'Per-task isolation: each card owns its own terminal sessions, browser pane, worktree, and editor.',
    'CLI companion (`slay`) mirrors task and browser workflows from any shell.',
    'Issue sync with Linear, GitHub Issues, and Jira for teams that plan externally.'
